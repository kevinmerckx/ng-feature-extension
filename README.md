# FeatureExtension

In this repository, we demonstrate how we can use `InjectionToken`, `ngComponentOutlet` and extension modules to provide an API that feature modules can use to display custom content in the toolbar of the application shell.

## Run

Using Nodejs (Node 14 at least, maybe it works for Node 12 as well but untested):

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
